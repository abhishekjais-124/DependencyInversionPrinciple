Dependency Inversion Principle

The principle states: High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details.

The dependency inversion principle helps us to couple software modules loosely. The principle was arrived at after many years of coupling software modules.
